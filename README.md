 Personal Resume Website

 Introduction

This is a personal resume website built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site showcases my skills, work experience, education, projects, and contact information in a visually appealing, responsive, and user-friendly format. It serves as both a professional portfolio and a demonstration of my web development abilities.
